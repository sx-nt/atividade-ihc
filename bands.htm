  <p class=text>Thank you for trying to help a lost bird find it's way back home! Most likely, the bird belongs to an owner within a short distance of where you found it. If you are able to capture the bird and can fully read it's band number, chances are good that it can be returned.  However, the mere description of a white bird with a colored band makes it impossible for us to try and help find the owner. </p>
  <p class=text>If you find a white bird where the band letters show it as a <em><strong>WDRP</strong> registered bird</em>, we will gladly help you get the bird back to it's owner. </p>
  <p class=text>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:whtdoves@yahoo.com">Lost Bird</a>!</p>
  <p class=text>If you are unable to find the information necessary to trace back to the owner, contact a local Animal Rescue or Animal Control. These groups normally have contacts to pigeon fanciers who may be willing to take the bird in. Pet shops, feed stores and veterinarians may also be able to help. </p>
