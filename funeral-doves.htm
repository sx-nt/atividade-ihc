            The releasing of white doves at funerals and memorials is quickly becoming a popular way of adding that special touch to your loved one's
            memorial or funeral service.
            <br><br>
            In addition to flowers, <b>a White Dove release for a funeral or memorial</b> is one of the most loving and inspirational gifts to give to a loved one. The releasing of a white dove helps to begin the grieving process by opening the doors to "letting go" and is sure to live on in the memories of all attending the service. The trained white birds will soar into the sky, usually circling any number of times in a group before returning to their home lofts at distances up to several hundred miles.

            At the end of the graveside service, family members release the doves from beautifully decorated baskets. The flock ascends into the sky and circles the area awaiting the spirit of the loved one to join them. Moments later, a single white dove, representing your loved one's spirit, is then released by a family member. The spirit dove joins the flock of "Angels," and all together they make the spiritual flight home.
